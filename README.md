Detecting Loop in Linkedlist

Condsider two people jogging. One is very young man and other is old lady. young man is faster than the lady and after sometimes the man sees the lady again. What does this suggest? the track they are jogging on is circular. How do we find out if the track is circular or not?
This problem can also be asked like find if there is any loop in given linked list.
We use two pointer. One is fast pointer and other is slow pointer. Fast pointer moves twice faster than slow pointer. IF two pointers meet then there exists loop otherwise there is no loop.
More info about the problem can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection
